# Sleeping-Cell-KPI-Data
The repository contains three tables (.csv file) of network Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data for the sleeping cell detection.

The sleeping cells are one kind of special anomaly cells in the networks, these cells generally go into outage or perform poorly to provide degraded service for subscribers without triggering alarms. These sleeping cells are with complex formation reasons, including not only software but also hardware failures, and can only recover after manual intervention such as reset operations.

We collect and store the KPI data of 11 days from Sep 3, 2018, consisting of the corresponding data of 36 KPIs of several cells and show three cells' KPI data in the .csv files. Moreover, we note that the information indicators such as cell ID and so on are not regarded as KPIs.
